📊 Sales Forecasting & Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze sales performance, track KPIs, and forecast future sales trends. This project helps businesses make data-driven decisions by identifying growth opportunities, evaluating product performance, and predicting demand more accurately.

💼 Business Problem

The company faced several challenges:

Lack of visibility into regional and product-level sales performance.
